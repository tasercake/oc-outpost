# Coding Agent Research

Building the ultimate coding agent for Tavus. Long-running research project.

## Structure
- `sources/` — raw notes per source (one file per article/post)
- `notes/` — thematic notes (architecture patterns, eval strategies, etc.)
- `syntheses/` — cross-cutting analysis and recommendations
- `INDEX.md` — master index of all sources and status

## Principles
- Nobody has all the answers yet
- X/Twitter is useful but verify credentials
- Focus on: what worked, what failed, architectural decisions, eval strategies
- Always note what's applicable to Tavus's context (AI video, real-time systems)
